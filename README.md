# BootForge 🔥

BootForge is a backend-focused Spring Boot configuration generation service designed to help developers quickly create clean, production-ready configuration files.

Instead of manually remembering dozens of Spring Boot properties, BootForge allows you to:

- Generate application.properties or application.yml

- Configure database, JPA, logging, server, and actuator settings

- Apply safe, opinionated defaults

- Validate inputs to prevent common misconfigurations

- Instantly preview and copy generated configuration

BootForge is built with a clean domain-driven design approach and demonstrates:

- Strong Java domain modeling

- Strategy pattern for output formatting

- Input validation and defensive configuration

- Clean separation of concerns

- Dockerized deployment

## Why BootForge?

Spring Boot applications often require repetitive setup and careful configuration. BootForge streamlines this process by providing a structured, validated way to generate configuration files that follow best practices.

This project focuses on backend engineering principles rather than frontend complexity.
